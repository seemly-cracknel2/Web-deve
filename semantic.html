                    The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is a crocodilian native to saltwater habitats, brackish
                    wetlands and
                    freshwater rivers from India's east coast across Southeast Asia and the Sundaland to northern
                    Australia and Micronesia.
                    It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996.[2] It was hunted for its skin
                    throughout its range
                    up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous
                    to humans.
