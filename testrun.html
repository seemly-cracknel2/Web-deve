    <p>Pakistan,[e] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,[f] is a country in South Asia. It is the fifth-most
        populous
        country, with a population of over 241.5 million,[c] having the second-largest Muslim population as of 2023.
        Islamabad
        is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest
        country by
        area. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the
        southeast, it
        shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the
        northeast.
        It shares a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the northwest by
        Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor.

        Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in
        Balochistan, the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age,[10] and the ancient Gandhara civilisation.[11] The
        regions
        that compose the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the
        Achaemenid,
        the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[12] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the
        Ghaznavids,
        the Delhi Sultanate, the Samma, the Shah Miris, the Mughals,[13] and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to
        1947.</p>
